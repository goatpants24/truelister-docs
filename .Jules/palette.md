## 2025-05-15 - Title Character Counter
**Learning:** Marketplace item titles should adhere to an 80-character limit, with visual character counters providing thresholds: amber at 70 characters and red at 80+ to guide users toward optimal title lengths.
**Action:** Use a `fieldFooter` container to align error messages and character counters for a consistent look.

## 2025-05-15 - Chip Accessibility
**Learning:** Interactive chips used for multi-selection must include `accessibilityRole="button"` and `accessibilityState={{ selected: isSelected }}` to ensure screen readers correctly convey their purpose and state.
**Action:** Always include accessibility props when using `TouchableOpacity` for selection elements.
