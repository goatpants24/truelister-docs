## 2025-03-24 - [Title Character Counter]
**Learning:** Real-time character counters are essential for marketplace apps to prevent users from exceeding field limits (e.g., eBay's 80-char limit) and provide immediate visual feedback via color thresholds.
**Action:** Always include character counters for fields with strict character limits, and use visual indicators (Amber/Red) to signal approaching and exceeding the limit.

## 2025-03-24 - [Home Screen Interactivity and Accessibility]
**Learning:** Pull-to-refresh is a critical micro-UX pattern for data-driven apps, providing a familiar and intuitive way to update content. Combined with ARIA roles and accessibility states (selected), it ensures the interface is both delightful and usable for all users.
**Action:** Implement pull-to-refresh for primary lists and ensure all mode/selection toggles include `accessibilityRole="button"` and `accessibilityState={{ selected: boolean }}`.

## 2026-05-17 - [Single CTA Focus]
**Learning:** UX improvements must strictly adhere to the "ONE improvement" and "< 50 lines" constraints. Bundling multiple helpful features (like Pull-to-Refresh with a New Item CTA) can lead to PR rejection due to scope creep.
**Action:** Prioritize the highest-impact UX win and implement only that, along with essential accessibility metadata.
