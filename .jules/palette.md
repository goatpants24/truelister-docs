**Learning:** Real-time character counters are essential for marketplace apps to prevent users from exceeding field limits (e.g., eBay's 80-char limit) and provide immediate visual feedback via color thresholds.

**Learning:** Pull-to-refresh is a critical micro-UX pattern for data-driven apps, providing a familiar and intuitive way to update content. Combined with ARIA roles and accessibility states (selected), it ensures the interface is both delightful and usable for all users.
**Action:** Implement pull-to-refresh for primary lists and ensure all mode/selection toggles include `accessibilityRole="button"` and `accessibilityState={{ selected: boolean }}`.
